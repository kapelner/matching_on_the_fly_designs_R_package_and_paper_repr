\title{Fast Cox Proportional Hazards Regression (R Wrapper)}
\usage{
fast_coxph_regression(Xmm, y, dead)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xmm}{A numeric matrix of predictor variables. It is assumed that an intercept term
is handled implicitly by the Cox model and should not be included in \code{Xmm}.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing the observed time (event time or censoring time).}

\item{dead}{A numeric vector (0 or 1) indicating event status (1 for event, 0 for censored).}
}
\value{
A list containing the following component:
\item{b}{A numeric vector of the estimated Cox regression coefficients.}
}
\description{
This function provides a fast implementation of Cox Proportional Hazards regression
by wrapping the \code{glmnet} package's Cox model with \code{lambda = 0}.
It is designed to efficiently estimate regression coefficients for time-to-event data
without penalization.
