\title{Fast Logistic Regression with Variance Calculation (R Wrapper)}
\usage{
fast_logistic_regression_with_var(Xmm, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xmm}{A numeric matrix of predictor variables. It is assumed that an intercept column
(e.g., a column of ones) is already included in \code{Xmm} if desired.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of the response variable, expected to be binary (0 or 1).}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\describe{
\item{b}{A numeric vector of the obtained logistic regression coefficients.}
\item{ssq_b_2}{The squared standard error (variance) of the second estimated coefficient,
  which typically corresponds to the treatment effect.}
}
}
\description{
This function provides a fast implementation of logistic regression, wrapping a C++ backend.
It estimates regression coefficients for binary outcomes and specifically computes the
variance of the second coefficient (assumed to be the treatment effect).

\examples{

# Generate some sample data
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
p <- 2
X_log_var <- cbind(1, rnorm(n)) # X with intercept and one predictor
beta_log_var <- c(0.5, 1) # First is intercept, second is treatment effect

prob_var <- exp(lin_pred_var) / (1 + exp(lin_pred_var))
y_log_var <- rbinom(n, 1, prob_var)
