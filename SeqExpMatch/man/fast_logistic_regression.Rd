\title{Fast Logistic Regression (R Wrapper)}
\usage{
fast_logistic_regression(Xmm, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xmm}{A numeric matrix of predictor variables. It is assumed that an intercept column
(e.g., a column of ones) is already included in \code{Xmm} if desired.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of the response variable, expected to be binary (0 or 1).}
}
\value{
A list containing the following component:
\describe{
\item{b}{A numeric vector of the estimated logistic regression coefficients.}
}
}
\description{
This function provides a fast implementation of logistic regression by wrapping
a C++ backend function. It is designed to efficiently estimate regression coefficients
for binary outcomes without computing variance components.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate some sample data
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
p <- 2
X_log <- cbind(1, matrix(rnorm(n * (p - 1)), ncol = p - 1)) # X with intercept
beta_log <- c(0.5, 1)
lin_pred <- X_log \%*\% beta_log
prob <- exp(lin_pred) / (1 + exp(lin_pred))
y_log <- rbinom(n, 1, prob)

# Fit logistic regression using fast_logistic_regression
fit_logistic <- fast_logistic_regression(Xmm = X_log, y = y_log)
print(fit_logistic$b)

# Compare with standard R glm()
glm_fit <- glm(y_log ~ X_log - 1, family = binomial) # -1 because X_log already has intercept
print(coef(glm_fit))
}
