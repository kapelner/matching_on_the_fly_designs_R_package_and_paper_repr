\title{Calculates the standard error of the restricted mean survival time for a single group.}
\usage{
get_restricted_mean_se_for_group(y, dead)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric vector of survival times.}

\item{dead}{Integer vector of event indicators (1=event, 0=censored).}
}
\value{
The standard error of the restricted mean.
}
\description{
Uses the standard variance formula (Uno et al.):
  Var(RMST) = sum_j  A(t_j)^2 * d_j / (n_j * (n_j - d_j))
where A(t_j) = integral_{t_j}^{tau} S(u) du is the remaining area under the KM
curve from event time t_j to the last observation tau, d_j is the number of events
at t_j, and n_j is the number at risk just before t_j.
Terms where n_j == d_j are omitted: S drops to 0 there, so A(t_j) = 0 and the
contribution is 0 in the limit regardless of the undefined Greenwood denominator.
