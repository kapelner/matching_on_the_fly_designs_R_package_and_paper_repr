\title{Fast Negative Binomial Regression with Variance Calculation (R Wrapper)}
\usage{
fast_negbin_regression_with_var(Xmm, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xmm}{A numeric matrix of predictor variables. It is assumed that an intercept column
(e.g., a column of ones) is already included in \code{Xmm} if desired.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of the response variable, representing count data.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\item{b}{A numeric vector of the estimated negative binomial regression coefficients.}
\item{ssq_b_2}{The squared standard error (variance) of the second estimated coefficient,
  which typically corresponds to the treatment effect.}
}
\description{
This function provides a fast implementation of negative binomial regression, wrapping
a C++ backend. It is designed to efficiently estimate regression coefficients for count
data and computes the variance of the second coefficient (assumed to be the treatment effect),
assuming all observations are "not censored" (i.e., `dead = 1`).
