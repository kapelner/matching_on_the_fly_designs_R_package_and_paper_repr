\title{Fast Beta Regression (R Wrapper)}
\usage{
fast_beta_regression(Xmm, y, start_phi = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xmm}{A numeric matrix of predictor variables. It is assumed that an intercept column
(e.g., a column of ones) is already included in \code{Xmm} if desired.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of the response variable, with values strictly between 0 and 1.}

\item{start_phi}{A numeric value, the starting value for the precision parameter phi.
Defaults to 10.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following component:
\item{b}{A numeric vector of the estimated beta regression coefficients.}
}
\description{
This function provides a fast implementation of beta regression by wrapping
a C++ backend function. It is designed to efficiently estimate regression coefficients
for response variables that are continuous and restricted to the (0, 1) interval.
