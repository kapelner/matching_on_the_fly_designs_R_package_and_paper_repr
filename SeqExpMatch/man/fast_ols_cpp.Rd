\title{Fast Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression (C++ Backend)}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of predictor variables. It is assumed that an intercept column
(e.g., a column of ones) is already included in \code{X} if desired.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of the response variable.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\describe{
\item{b}{A numeric vector of the estimated regression coefficients.}
}
}
\description{
This function provides a highly optimized implementation of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
regression using the Eigen C++ library for numerical computations. It is designed for speed
when only the regression coefficients are needed, without variance-covariance matrices
or other statistical inference components.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate some sample data
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
p <- 3
X_mat <- cbind(1, matrix(rnorm(n * (p - 1)), ncol = p - 1)) # X with intercept
y_vec <- X_mat \%*\% c(1, 0.5, -0.2) + rnorm(n, sd = 0.5)

# Fit OLS using fast_ols_cpp
fit_ols <- fast_ols_cpp(X = X_mat, y = y_vec)
print(fit_ols$b)

# Compare with standard R lm()
lm_fit <- lm(y_vec ~ X_mat - 1) # -1 because X_mat already has intercept
print(coef(lm_fit))
}
