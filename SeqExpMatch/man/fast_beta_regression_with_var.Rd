\title{Fast Beta Regression with Variance Calculation (R Wrapper)}
\usage{
fast_beta_regression_with_var(Xmm, y, start_phi = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xmm}{A numeric matrix of predictor variables. It is assumed that an intercept column
(e.g., a column of ones) is already included in \code{Xmm} if desired.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of the response variable, with values strictly between 0 and 1.}

\item{start_phi}{A numeric value, the starting value for the precision parameter phi.
Defaults to 10.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\item{b}{A numeric vector of the estimated beta regression coefficients.}
\item{ssq_b_2}{The squared standard error (variance) of the second estimated coefficient,
  which typically corresponds to the treatment effect.}
}
\description{
This function provides a fast implementation of beta regression, wrapping a C++ backend.
It estimates regression coefficients for response variables that are continuous and
restricted to the (0, 1) interval, and specifically computes the variance
of the second coefficient (assumed to be the treatment effect).
