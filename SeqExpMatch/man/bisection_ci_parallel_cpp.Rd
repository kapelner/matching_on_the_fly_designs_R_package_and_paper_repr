\title{Sequential computation of both CI bounds (called from R-level parallelism)}
\usage{
bisection_ci_parallel_cpp(
  pval_fn,
  nsim_exact_test,
  l_lower,
  u_lower,
  l_upper,
  u_upper,
  pval_th,
  tol,
  transform_responses,
  num_cores = 1L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pval_fn}{R function: pval_fn(nsim, delta, transform_responses, num_cores)}

\item{nsim_exact_test}{Number of randomization iterations}

\item{l_lower}{Initial lower bound for lower CI bound search}

\item{u_lower}{Initial upper bound for lower CI bound search (typically the estimate)}

\item{l_upper}{Initial lower bound for upper CI bound search (typically the estimate)}

\item{u_upper}{Initial upper bound for upper CI bound search}

\item{pval_th}{P-value threshold (typically alpha/2 for two-sided CI)}

\item{tol}{Tolerance for convergence (in p-value space)}

\item{transform_responses}{String: "none", "log", or "logit"}

\item{num_cores}{Passed through to pval_fn for inner parallelism}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length 2: [lower_bound, upper_bound]
}
\description{
This function is kept for backwards compatibility but the outer parallelism
(running lower/upper bounds simultaneously) is now handled at the R level via
parallel::mclapply, which is safe. Calling R functions from OpenMP threads is
undefined behaviour in R and caused process crashes.
